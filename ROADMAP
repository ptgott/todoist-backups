# ROADMAP

- Break up the `main` function for easier testing and code replacement.
- A `oneshot` flag for manually testing the config
- Ensure that the OneDrive credentials are scoped only to the given directory.
- Validate the config
- Add retries to HTTP requests in the main loop on 5xx responses
- Use a logger instead of print statements since this will be running remotely
- When there are errors, notify me via email. Extract the One Newsletter email package into a separate repo to make this easier. I am guessing that any other daemons I run on VMs will need to notify me as well,
so this is something that I would benefit from generalizing.
- Use a mock clock instead of the `time` package and add e2e tests with mocked Todoist and OneDrive servers.
