# ROADMAP

- Send the first API requests immediately after starting the program (not after the first interval) so we can validate the config easily.
- Ensure that the OneDrive credentials are scoped only to the given directory.
- Add retries to HTTP requests in the main loop on 5xx responses
- Use a logger instead of print statements since this will be running remotely
